EDIT DOCUMENTS
==============
All editing should be done directly in the src directory

CREATE A NEW DOCUMENT
=====================
1) choose a name for the document
2) create a file src/[name].sgml
3) rerun the configure command

BUILD EXISTING DOCUMENTATION
=============================
1) After checking out the docs directory, 
   use the configure command to set up
   docbook and the Makefile

	 ** note **
	 If a new document has been added since the last time configure was run
	 the configure script must be rerun in order to build the new document.

   % configure
   loading cache ./config.cache
   checking whether make sets ${MAKE}... (cached) yes
   checking for db2html... (cached) /usr/bin/db2html
   checking for db2pdf... (cached) /usr/bin/db2pdf
   checking for db2rtf... (cached) /usr/bin/db2rtf
   creating ./config.status
   creating Makefile.inc
   creating ldp.dsl

2) Use the make command to list the available documents.

   % make

	 Inca Documentation

	 Available targets:
     <doc>.<fmt> where <doc> = [design ] and
                       <fmt> = [pdf,html,rtf]
     <doc>       where <doc> = [design ]
		             Creates html, pdf, and rtf for doc all
								 Creates all html, pdf, and rtf files
     clean       Deletes generated docbook files 
		 clean-all   Does 'clean' and deletes html, pdf, and rtf files
		 distclean   Does 'clean-all' and deletes autoconf generated files

		 In this example design is the only document availabe for building.


3) Use the make command to create html, pdf 
   and rtf files.  Type "make" for help. 

   %make design

	 - or -

	 %make design.html
	 to only create the html file
