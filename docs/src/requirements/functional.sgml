<variableList>
<varListEntry>
  <term><emphasis>Data collected should not be lost due to the failure of a
	single component.</emphasis></term>
	<listItem><para>
		In the event of a component failure data that has already been collected
		should be saved within another component until the failed component
		recovers.
	</para></listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Data should be archived.
	</emphasis></term>
  <listItem>
	  <para>
		A archiving policy should be established that will remove data as it
		becomes less valuable.  That policy should be configurable to each piece
		of data.
		</para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Data about an entire virtual organization should be
	available from a single point.</emphasis></term>
  <listItem>
	  <para>
		In the case that data is about a single VO does not exist in a single
		location the queries should be forwarded and the results merged in such a
		way that the querying entity is not aware of the distribution of data.
		</para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Data collection scheduling and execution should be flexible
	and configurable.</emphasis></term>
	<listItem>
		<para>The frequency of data collection should be configurable on a
		piece-by-piece basis.  Some pieces of data will be collected from more
		than one resource and will require coordination.  </para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Installation, setup, and maintenance of the Inca deployment
	should be simple, straightforward, configurable, and
	pain-free.</emphasis></term>
	<listItem>
	  <para>Everything that can be automated, should be automated
			(e.g., no manual copying of files when updates).  The installation,
			setup, and configuration should be done from a single location and
			then propogated to the appropriate locations.  There will be GUI and
			command-line front-ends setup with defaults to so it's easy to learn
			and configurable.  
		</para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Data collection should be configurable and extensible
	on a per-resource basis.</emphasis></term>
	<listItem>
	  <para>
	  System administrators should be able to determine which data will be
	  collected on a resource, the frequency of collection, and the
	  disposition of the collected data.  Interfaces provided with Inca
	  should allow individual administrators to define custom data
	  collectors to augment those provided by the standard Inca system.
	  </para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Security</emphasis></term>
	<listItem>
	  <para>One Inca component should be able to connect to another Inca
		component only if they are authenticated and authorized.  A user should
		be able to interact with an Inca component only if they are authenticated
		and authorized.  Grid credentials should be created on one reporter agent
		and propogated (or delegated) to the other reporter agents and managers.
		</para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<varListEntry>
	<term><emphasis>Self Monitoring</emphasis></term>
	<listItem>
			<para>By default, Inca should be self-monitoring and record its CPU and
			memory usage for its components and reporters.  The usage information
			would be archived and stored in the depot for query.
			</para>
	</listItem>
</varListEntry>
