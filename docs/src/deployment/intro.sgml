Deployment of the Inca system covers both the software for core Inca components
(Reporter Agent, Reporter Manager, Depot) and the suite of standard Inca
Reporters.

<para>
We expect the code for the Inca Reporter suite to change fairly rapidly as new
Reporters are developed and existing Reporters improved.  Because the code for
the core components is expected to change much more slowly, these two pieces of
the Inca software will have independent release cycles after the initial
release.
