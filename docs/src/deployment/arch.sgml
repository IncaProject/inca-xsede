Reporters will be available for download from <emphasis>Reporter
Repositories</emphasis> (RRs) that provide catalogs and access to their
contents via a port.  After receiving a list of RRs from the Reporter Agent
GUI (RAG), a Reporter Agent (RA) will retrieve the catalogs from all the
repositories and return the merged list of available Reporters.  The RAG will
allow the system administrator to select and configure the desired Reporters,
after which it will return a schedule to the RA.  The RA will download each
desired Reporter from its RR and send it to the appropriate Reporter Manager
as part of the next polling dialog.
