<para>
As indicated in the above section, there are two components of the control
system:  a reporter agent and reporter manager.  The reporter agent is the
front-end to the control framework of Inca and orchestrates the execution of
reporters on VO resources.  A reporter manager is a thin
client running on each resource to enable local execution of reporters.  
The architecture and lifecycle of each component is described further in the
following subsections.
