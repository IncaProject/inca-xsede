            The Inca software will include a set of tools that provide for easy
            administration of an Inca installation.  The most significant of these will be
            the <emphasis>Inca Installation Interface</emphasis> (I3), which will allow
            the Inca administrator to specify the RRs to be used, select reporters to be
            run, and configure the operation of the RAs, RMs, and Depots within a VO.

                                    The Inca administrator will only need to tell the RA via the I3 that
                                    reporters should be retrieved from a particular set of repositories.
                                    The RA will encapsulate all the knowledge of the contents of Reporter
                                    Repositories and the format of Reporter packages.

                                    Tools packaged with Inca will assist Inca administrators in creating local
                                    Reporter repositories which may be specified to the RA as sources for
                                    reporter packages.

                                    The I3 will provide the Inca administrator with the option of automatically

                                    versions as they become available.

            The I3 provides to the Inca administrator a client interface to an RA.  All
            information about the configuration of an Inca installation is kept with the
            RA and retrieved by the I3 as needed.
        </para>
        <para>
            The I3 allows the Inca administrator to specify a list of RRs that serve as the
            source of reporters for the installation.  The I3 forwards this list to the RA,
            which retrieves catalog information from each RR, merges the catalogs, and
            returns the complete list of available reporters to the I3.  The administrator
            selects a set of reporters to run on installation resources, specifying run
            attributes for each. This information is returned to the RA, which uses it to
            download reporters from the RRs and construct schedules for transmission to RMs.
        </para>
        <para>
            The attributes of a particular reporter run include: the name and version of
            the reporter; the resource on which it is to be run (i.e., the RM name), any
            command-line arguments to be passed; the initial run time; how often the
            reporter should be run; the Depot(s) to which the results should be sent;
            optionally, the maximum CPU and/or wall clock time that a single reporter run
            will be allowed to consume; a list of expected output values.  For convenience,
            the version of a reporter may be specified as "current", in which case the
            RA will automatically update the reporter as new versions become available.
