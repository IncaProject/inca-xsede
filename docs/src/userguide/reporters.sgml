<title>Inca Reporters</title>

<para>
Inca reporters are executable programs and scripts, generally small, that test
and report the health and characteristics of a system.  Because they are
executables, Inca reporters are independent of the rest of the Inca system.
Reporters can be run from the command line; their output analyzed by hand or by
non-Inca tools.  Incorporating your own reporters into a running Inca system
requires only writing the reporters and telling the Agent where to find them.

All Inca reporters must support the command line arguments listed in the table
below.  In addition, a reporter may support additional command line arguments
specific to that reporter's task.

    Do not run the reporter; instead, print information on running it.  If the
    the value of the verbose argument is 0, this information will be readable
    text; otherwise, it will be reporter XML.

    Determine what the reporter prints.  A verbose level of 0 indicates that
    the reporter prints only 'completed' or 'failed', depending on the outcome
    of its testing.  Verbose level 1 produces XML that reports the testing
    result, and verbose level 2 adds additional tags to this XML to give
    instructions on running the reporter.
