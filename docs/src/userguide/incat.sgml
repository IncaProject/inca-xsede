  Inca provides a graphical administration tool, named incat, that allows you
  to configure your deployment.  Using incat, you can specify the repositories
  from which Inca should retrieve reporters, the resources where you wish to
  run reporters, and which reporters you wish to run on each resource.
  </para><para>
  The simplest way to run incat is via the inca command line tool: "inca
  start incat".  You can connect incat to a running Inca agent via the
  --agent option, e.g., "inca start incat --agent blue.ufo.edu:5678".
  </para><para>
  As mentioned in the previous section, you can use the inca command line tool
  to install a default Inca configuration on a resource.  The discussion below
  will describe how to use incat to set up the same configuration.

  incat begins by showing the panel for Inca reporter repositories.  The three
  panes in the panel display the list of repositiories you've specified, the
  list of reporters contained within those repositories, and property
  information for the currently-selected reporter.  Buttons underneath the
  Repositories pane allow you to add and delete repositories from your list.
  If your list contains multiple repositories, a checkbox underneath the
  Reporters pane indicates whether the reporter list includes reporters from
  all repositories or only from the selected one.  Finally, pressing the "Show"
  button underneath the Reporters pane will open a text window that contains
  the source code of the currently-selected reporter.
  </para>
  <para>
  The default Inca configuration retrieves reporters from the Inca project
  repository.  To add this repository to your list, press the "Add" button
  underneath the Repositories pane, enter the URL
  "http://inca.sdsc.edu/2.0/repository" in the pop-up window that appears, then
  press the "OK" button.  Within a few seconds you should see the repository
  URL appear in the Repositories pane, a list of reporters in the Reporters
  pane, and properties for the first reporter in the Reporter Properties pane.
  If you like, you can select reporters in the Reporters pane and display their
  source code by pressing the "Show" button.  (Double-clicking the reporter
  name in the reporter list does the same thing.)

  <title>Resources</title>
  <!-- TODO add graphic -->
  <para>
  Pressing the "Resource Configuration" tab near the top of the incat window
  takes you to incat's resource specification panel.  Here you can enter and
  edit information about the hosts on which you want Inca to run reporters.
  The panes on this panel show resource groups (sets of hosts) that you've
  defined, a set of macros that you can use when defining reporter series to
  run on a paticular resource, and a list of hosts that are included in the
  selected resource.  A set of buttons underneath the Resource Group pane allow
  you to add, edit, and delete resource groups, and a similar set underneath
  the Macros pane allow you to add, edit, and delete macros associated with
  the currently-selected resource group.
  </para>
  <para>
  The default Inca configuration defines two resource groups--one that
  specifies the host where the Inca agent is running and another container
  group that can be extended to include both this host and any others that
  you care to define.  To define these in incat, press the "Add" button
  underneath the Resource Groups pane to open the resource edit window.
  In the "Group Name" text box, enter the name "siteA".  (This name choice
  is arbitrary; "agentHost" or "local" would work just as well.)  In the
  "Members" text box, enter either "localhost" or the DNS name of the host
  where the Inca agent is running, then select "local" on the "Access Method"
  pull-down list.  This indicates that the Inca agent can access this host
  directly without going through either Globus or ssh (i.e., it's the same
  host where the agent is running).  The boxes for the installation directory
  and proxy information can be left blank.  The agent will use a default
  directory to install the Inca reporter manager, and proxy information isn't
  needed for this installation.  Press "OK" to complete entry of this resource,
  and incat will display siteA in the Resource Groups pane.
  <!-- TODO add graphic -->
  </para>
  <para>
  Press the "Add" button again to add a second resource group.  Give this one
  the name "defaultvo" and enter "siteA" in the "Members" text box.  This tells
  incat that any hosts in the "siteA" group (localhost, in this case) are also
  part of the "defaultvo" group.  If you defined other groups, "siteB",
  "siteC", etc., you could include these in "defaultvo" by listing them in the
  "Members" text box, separated by spaces.  Press "OK" to complete entry of
  this resource.  Notice that the "Members" panel lists localhost as a member
  of both the defaultvo and siteA resources.

  <section id="userguide-incat-suites">
  <title>Suites</title>
  <!-- TODO add graphic -->
  <para>
  Pressing the "Suites" tab near the top of the incat window takes you to
  incat's suite/series specification panel.  Here you specify the reporters
  you want to run, which resources to run them on, how frequently to run them,
  and the parameters to use when running them.
  </para>
  <para>
  A suite groups a set of reporter series.  Suites are largely a convenience
  for organizing related series, and the decision as to whether to place all
  your series into a single suite or to divide them into multiple suites is up
  to you.  One consideration is that the Inca consumer uses suites as its
  primary structure for organizing the display of reporter results, so
  organizing related series into suites may make the consumer web pages more
  useful.
  </para>
  <para>
  The default Inca configuration defines a single suite named "TestSuiteLocal"
  that contains eight series.  Press the "Add" button underneath the "Suites"
  pane, enter "TestSuiteLocal" in the pop-up window, then press the "OK"
  button.  You're now ready to add series to this new suite.  Press the "Add"
  button underneath the "Series" pane.
