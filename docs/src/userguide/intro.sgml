Determining whether a Grid is up in the face of complex Grid software
deployments can be difficult and depends on the types of applications and
users that utilize it.  By detailing a set of software, services, and features
that should be available on a Grid in a machine-readable format, a Grid can be
tested periodically by an automated system to verify its health and usability
to users.  To this end, we have developed Inca as a flexible framework to
perform periodic, user-level functionality testing and performance measurement
of Grid systems.  It includes mechanisms to schedule the execution of
information gathering scripts, and to collect, archive, publish, and display
data
