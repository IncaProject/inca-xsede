>  Inca provides a graphical administration tool, named incat, that allows you
  to configure your deployment.  Using incat, you can specify the repositories
  from which Inca should retrieve reporters, the hosts where you wish to
  run reporters, and which reporters you wish to run on each host.
  <P
><IMG
SRC="figures/arch-incat.jpg"

  </P
><P
>  You can connect incat to a running Inca Agent via the
  -A option, e.g., "cd $INCA_DIST; ./bin/inca start incat -A localhost:6323".
  </P
><P
>  As mentioned in the <A
HREF="userguide-quickstart.html#QS-STEP5"
>Quick Start guide</A
>, you
  can execute "./bin/inca default" from the command line to install a default Inca configuration.
  The discussion below describes how you would use incat to specify the same
  configuration.  Before continuing, use the inca script to start both a Depot
  and an Agent on your host.

  The default Inca configuration retrieves reporters from the 
  $INCA_DIST/Inca-Reporter-* repository on the agent machine.  To add this repository to your list, press the Add button in the
  Repositories section, enter the file:/ location of the Packages.gz file
  in the pop-up window that appears, then press the OK button.  Within a few
  seconds you should see the repository appear in the Repositories list, a
  set of reporters in the Reporters list, and properties for the first reporter
  in the Reporter Properties list.  Reporter source code is viewable by double clicking on a reporter name or by selecting 
  the reporter name and pressing the "Show" button.

  the name "defaultGrid" and enter "localResource" in the Members text box.  This tells
  incat that any hosts in the "localResource" group (localhost, in this case) are also
  part of the defaultGrid group.  If you defined other groups, "siteB", "siteC",
  etc., you could include these in defaultGrid by listing them in the Members

  already connected to your Agent.  Otherwise, use the "Connect" option in
  incat's Agent menu to establish a connection.  Once you're connected, you can
  use the "Commit" option in the Agent menu to send the configuration to the
  Agent (<A
HREF="userguide-incat.html#INCAT.COMMIT.FIG"
>Figure 16</A

  the host specified in incat's "Resource Configuration" panel and begin running the reporters you specified in the "Suite Series" panel.

  control over Inca execution on the group.  For a manual resource group you
  must start the Reporter Manager on the command line and restart it any time
  you want to change the reporter series configuration for the group.  The
  Agent will NOT automatically start a Reporter Manager for a manual resource
  as it will for local, ssh, or globus2 resources.  For a manual resource group, 
  incat provides a text box for you to enter an email that should be notified 
  when the Inca configuration on the resource needs to be updated.

><P
>ssh:</P
><P
>  The Agent starts a Reporter Manager on a remote machine using ssh to access
  the remote machine.  The Agent must have ssh key access to the remote machine.
  Reporter Manager files are copied from the Agent to the
  remote machine using sftp.  For ssh resource groups, incat provides text
  boxes for you to enter the login id, password, and path to the ssh key file
  on the Agent machine.  For security purposes, incat displays asterisks for
  the password and encrypts it when you save the configuration to a file.
  </P

><LI
><P
>globus2:</P
><P
>  The Agent starts a Reporter Manager on a remote machine using globus to
  access the remote machine.  Reporter Manager files are copied from the Agent
  to the remote machine using GridFtp.  When you select globus2 in the Access
  Method pull-down, incat provides text boxes for you to enter contact
  information for the resource's Globus Gram and GridFtp servers.  If you leave
  these boxes blank, Inca defaults to ports 2119 and 2811, respectively, for
  the first host in the resource group's member list.  Access to Globus hosts
  requires an active Globus proxy on the Agent's host.  You can either create a
  manual proxy on the Agent machine before starting, or you can store a proxy
  on a myproxy server and complete the four incat proxy dialog boxes (see
  below) so that the Agent can obtain one as needed.

  For example, suppose you wanted to add three series to the configuration
  defined above to measure the ping time to three different hosts, named
  blue.ufo.edu, green.ufo.edu, and red.ufo.edu.  One approach would be to
  define a series for blue, use the Clone button in the Series section
  of the Suites panel to make two copies, then modify them to ping green and
  red.
  </P
><P
>  A better approach is to use a macro for the host names and let Inca replicate
  the series for you.  In the Resource Configuration panel, click on
  defaultGrid in the Resource Group section.  Next, press the Add button
  beneath the Macros section.  This opens a dialog box that allows you to enter
  the name and value(s) of a macro associated with the current resource group.

  targets macro now appears in the Macros section of the Resource Configuration
  panel.

  a resource group other than the one selected.  You can override an inherited
  macro value by selecting the macro in the Macros panel and pressing the Edit
  button to open the macro edit dialog.  After you change the macro value and
  press OK, the updated macro definition will show in black in the Macros
  panel, indicating that the resource is no longer using the inherited value.

  resource group to localResource.
  </P
><P
>  In the host text box in the Arguments section of the dialog, enter
  "@targets@.ufo.edu".  Macro references in incat are indicated by placing a
  "@" before and after the macro name.  When the Inca Agent encounters a macro
  reference in a series, it makes one copy of the series for each value of the
  macro.  Since the targets macro has three values--blue, green, and red--the
  Inca Agent will make three copies of this series, substituting a single value
  for the macro reference in each.  In this case that means that you'll have
  one series with a host argument of "blue.ufo.edu", one with a host argument
  of "green.ufo.edu", and one with a host argument of "red.ufo.edu".
  </P
><P
>  The inca web pages use the series nickname when displaying series results.
  If you leave the series nickname with its default value, the name of the
  reporter, then all three series will have the same nickname.  Instead, you
  can enter "ping_to_@targets@" in the nickname text box.  The Inca Agent will
  expand this reference in parallel with the reference in the host argument, so
  your three series will have the nicknames ping_to_blue, ping_to_green, and
  ping_to_red, respectively.

  As shown here, multi-line emails are specified by including newline markers
  ("\n") in the property value.  Inca uses the line in the value that contains
  "SUBJECT=" as the email subject; remaining lines are the email body.  Any
  lines that contain an undefined macro value are removed, so, in the above,
  the final line would not appear if the reporter execution didn't produce an
  error message.
  </P
><P
>  These are the macro names that Inca defines for your use in constructing
  notification emails:
