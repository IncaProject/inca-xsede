Abstract: Is TeraGrid up?
 
From a user's perspective, a Grid is "up" if the resources, services and software
required to run their application are available and working as expected.  By
detailing a set of software, services, and features that a user needs, a Grid can
be tested periodically by an automated system to verify its health and usability. 
To this end, we've developed Inca as a flexible framework for the automated
testing, benchmarking and monitoring of Grid systems. Inca includes mechanisms to
schedule the execution of information gathering scripts, and to collect, archive,
publish, and display data.  

Inca is currently deployed on all TeraGrid resources to monitor CTSS 3.0 software,
services, and environment and to perform other requested system tests and
benchmarks.  TeraGrid users can employ the information Inca collects to determine
whether their applications' requirements are being met on the resources where they
will be executed. This poster will describe the Inca project, illustrate how
TeraGrid users can benefit from Inca tools, describe future plans for making more
dynamic and user-oriented Inca tools, and solicit feedback from users regarding the
type of data they would like to see Inca collect and display.

Comments: We would also like to do a 5-10 minute presentation at the end of one of
the user tutorials.  Don Frederick (SDSC) is planning some of these sessions and is
aware of our request.
