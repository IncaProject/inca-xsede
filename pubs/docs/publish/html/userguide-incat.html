>  Inca provides a graphical administration tool, named incat, that allows you
  to configure your deployment.  Using incat, you can specify the repositories
  from which Inca should retrieve reporters, the hosts where you wish to
  run reporters, and which reporters you wish to run on each host.
  <P
><IMG
SRC="figures/arch/arch-incat.jpg"
ALIGN="CENTER"></P
>
  </P
><P
>  You can connect incat to a running Inca Agent via the
  -A option, e.g., "cd $INCA_DIST; ./bin/inca start incat -A localhost:6323".
  </P
><P
>  As mentioned in the <A
HREF="userguide-quickstart.html#QS-STEP5"
>Quick Start guide</A
>, you
  can execute "./bin/inca default" from the command line to install a default Inca configuration.
  The discussion below describes how you would use incat to specify the same
  configuration.  Before continuing, use the inca script to start both a Depot
  and an Agent on your host.

  The default Inca configuration retrieves reporters from the 
  $INCA_DIST/Inca-Reporter-* repository on the agent machine.  To add this repository to your list, press the Add button in the
  Repositories section, enter the file:/ location of the Packages.gz file
  in the pop-up window that appears, then press the OK button.  Within a few
  seconds you should see the repository appear in the Repositories list, a
  set of reporters in the Reporters list, and properties for the first reporter
  in the Reporter Properties list.  Reporter source code is viewable by double clicking on a reporter name or by selecting 
  the reporter name and pressing the "Show" button.

  the name "defaultGrid" and enter "localResource" in the Members text box.  This tells
  incat that any hosts in the "localResource" group (localhost, in this case) are also
  part of the defaultGrid group.  If you defined other groups, "siteB", "siteC",
  etc., you could include these in defaultGrid by listing them in the Members
  text box, separated by spaces.  Press OK to complete entry of this resource

  already connected to your Agent.  Otherwise, use the "Connect" option in
  incat's Agent menu to establish a connection.  Once you're connected, you can
  use the "Commit" option in the Agent menu to send the configuration to the
  Agent (<A
HREF="userguide-incat.html#INCAT.COMMIT.FIG"

  boxes for you to enter the login id, password, and path to the ssh key file
  on the Agent machine.  For security purposes, incat displays asterisks for
  the password and encrypts it when you save the configuration to a file.
  </P

>globus2:</P

  Method pull-down, incat provides text boxes for you to enter contact
  information for the resource's Globus GRAM and GridFTP servers.  If you leave
  these boxes blank, Inca defaults to ports 2119 and 2811, respectively, for
  the first host in the resource group's member list.  Access to Globus hosts
  requires an active Globus proxy on the Agent's host.  You can either create a
  manual proxy on the Agent machine before starting, or you can store a proxy
  on a myproxy server and complete the four incat proxy dialog boxes (see

>  Resource macros provide a shorthand for defining multiple, similar series.
  For example, suppose you wanted to add three series to the configuration
  defined above to measure the ping time to three different hosts, named
  blue.ufo.edu, green.ufo.edu, and red.ufo.edu.  One approach would be to
  define a series for blue, use the Clone button in the Series section
  of the Suites panel to make two copies, then modify them to ping green and
  red.
  </P
><P
>  A better approach is to use a macro for the host names and let Inca replicate
  the series for you.  In the Resource Configuration panel, click on
  defaultGrid in the Resource Group section.  Next, press the Add button
  beneath the Macros section.  This opens a dialog box that allows you to enter
  the name and value(s) of a macro associated with the current resource group.
  <P

  box, then use the "Add" button or hit "enter/return" to add "green" and
  "red" as the second and third values of the macro.  Afterwards, press OK.
  The definition of the targets macro now appears in the Macros section of the
  Resource Configuration panel.  You may also edit values in the list by
  selecting them, changing the value in the edit value box, and hitting
  "enter/return".  To delete macro values, select the value in the list
  and press the "Delete" button.
  <P
><IMG
SRC="figures/incat/macro1.jpg"

  </P

>The targets macro is also defined for the other resource groups since
  the defaultGrid contains all other groups.  As shown in
  <A
HREF="userguide-incat.html#INCAT.MACRO2.FIG"
>Figure 17</A
>, macros appear grey if they were defined in
  a resource group other than the one selected.  You can override an inherited
  macro value by selecting the macro in the Macros panel and pressing the Edit
  button to open the macro edit dialog.  After you change the macro value and
  press OK, the updated macro definition will show in black in the Macros
  panel, indicating that the resource is no longer using the inherited value.

  Add button underneath the Series section to open the series edit dialog.  In
  the dialog, set the reporter to grid.benchmark.performance.ping and the
  resource group to localResource.
  </P
><P
>  In the host text box in the Arguments section of the dialog, enter
  "@targets@.ufo.edu".  Macro references in incat are indicated by placing a
  "@" before and after the macro name.  When the Inca Agent encounters a macro
  reference in a series, it makes one copy of the series for each value of the
  macro.  Since the targets macro has three values--blue, green, and red--the
  Inca Agent will make three copies of this series, substituting a single value
  for the macro reference in each.  In this case that means that you'll have
  one series with a host argument of "blue.ufo.edu", one with a host argument
  of "green.ufo.edu", and one with a host argument of "red.ufo.edu".
  </P
><P
>  The inca web pages use the series nickname when displaying series results.
  If you leave the series nickname with its default value, the name of the
  reporter, then all three series will have the same nickname.  Instead, you
  can enter "ping_to_@targets@" in the nickname text box.  The Inca Agent will
  expand this reference in parallel with the reference in the host argument, so
  your three series will have the nicknames ping_to_blue, ping_to_green, and

>5.8.1. Configuring "all2all" Series</A
></H3
><P
>The "all2all" test results are calculated by the consumer.  Generally "all2all" series 
  are cross-site tests.  The images below illustrates an example of configuring an "all2all" ping series. 
  </P
><P
>First a new suite called "cross-site" is added to contain the series for our "all2all" tests:
  <P

ALIGN="CENTER"></P
>
  </P
><P
>Next we select the cross-site test that we'll execute (grid.benchmark.performance.ping) and configure 
  the targets with a "pingHosts" macro.  The consumer detects that this is an all2all series
  because the nickname and context contain all2all strings as described in the image below:
  <P

SRC="figures/incat/incat-annotated-all2all.jpg"
ALIGN="CENTER"></P
>
  </P
><P
>In addition to configuring the actual all2all tests, we also configure a summary series for the
  latest pass/fail results of each all2all test.  This summary will be used by the All2AllFilter described in <A
HREF="userguide-advanced-config.html#ALL2ALL-FILTER"
>Section 10.3.2</A
> to determine which resource is responsible for a failure.  For example, in the example above we created
  an all2all ping test to be executed on the defaultGrid resource group.  Each of defaultGrid resources is pinging three other resources: cuzco.sdsc.edu, inca.sdsc.edu and badhost.sdsc.edu.  The summary series will find the latest results for each of the resources being pinged in order to assess whether a new failure is the fault of the resource doing the ping or the resource being pinged.  For example, if two of the three resources in the defaultGrid group are unable to ping badhost.sdsc.edu, when the third resource in defaultGrid goes to ping badhost.sdsc.edu and fails we know that it's the fault of badhost.sdsc.edu and not the third resource (or subsequently any other resource until badhost.sdsc.edu is fixed).  Based on the results of the summary series, the All2AllFilter would mark this third resource as "NOT_AT_FAULT" for failing to ping badhost.sdsc.edu.</P
><P
>To configure a summary series for all2all tests, make a new series that will execute the "summary.successpct.performance" reporter with the following parameters:</P
><P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>"Context": contains a similar "nickname=all2all:testName_to_.*" string as the all2all tests being summarized. Note that ".*" replaces the "@pingHosts@" macro used above since we're only creating one series.  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"filter": same as the Context string minus "nickname=".  The reporter will get the latest results for all series whose nickname matches this string.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"ignoreErr": the regular expression that the summary reporter looks for in error strings when counting failures and if it finds it then the errors are marked neutrally.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"restId", "server" and "type": tell the reporter where to get the latest test results (in this example via the consumer at rocks-101.sdsc.edu using the "rest" URL).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"suite": the suite the all2all tests being summarized can be found in.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>"wgetArgs": extra arguments to use when wget'ing the test results.</P

>5.9. Series Comparison and Notification</A
></H2
><P
>  For a particular series, the Inca system by default reports only whether or
  not the series reporter was able to execute successfully--whether a version
  reporter was able to determine a package version, a unit reporter was able to
  run a program, etc.  Using Inca's comparison and notification feature, you
  can refine a series to define success more precisely and to receive
  notification from Inca when a series reporter detects a problem.  The bottom
  text boxes of the series edit dialog provide access to Inca's comparison
  and notification feature.

>  The comparison expression can test the content of the report body, the content of the
  report error message, or the value of any symbols defined in the report body
  by &#60;ID&#62; tags.  The expression may use any of the boolean operators
  &#60;, &#60;=, &#62;, &#62;=, ==, and !=, plus perl's pattern match (=~) and
  mismatch (!~) operators.  One simple test would be "body =~ /./", which would
  test whether the report body contained any characters.  Tests can be joined
  together by the &#38;&#38; and || operators.  Using these, you could ignore
  an expected, minor error with the test
  "body =~ /./ || errorMessage == 'Try again later'".
  </P
><P
>  As mentioned above, you can include symbols defined in the report body in
  your tests.  The Inca system uses the content of any subsequent tag as the
  symbol value.  For example, the body of the output of the gcc version
  reporter might be

  &#60;ID&#62; tag with no subsequent tag, the value of the symbol is defined

>  Inca supports the ability to run a script that notifies you of changes in a
  series comparison.  When you specify a series comparison in the incat series
  dialog, two additional components become visible.  The Notification Script
  pull-down menu allows you to select the script to run, and the Script
  Parameters text box allows you to enter parameters to pass to the script.
  By default, the Inca installation provides two notification scripts,
  EmailNotifier and LogNotifier.  The first sends email to each address
  specified by the script parameters; the second writes a message to the
  specified log file.  See <A
