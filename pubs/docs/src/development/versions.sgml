<title>Version Tracking Concepts</title>

<para>
Within Inca there are 2 major concepts behind versions.  The first is the Inca
version which is made of 2 number seperated by a period.  For the immediate
future it will always be 2.[releaseNumber] where releaseNumber starts at 0.
The second is the component versions.  They are tracked locally and made of 2
numbers as well.  Each should start at 1.1.  When a component is released its
version is a concatination of the two.  So the first depot release will be
2.0.1.1
</para>

<para>
The Inca version is updated each time all of the components are packaged and
released together.
</para>

<para>
The component versions are updated at 2 events.  The major version is
incremented each time the component reaches a point that it becomes a release
candidate.  The minor version is a reflection of which revision of the
release candidate was actually packaged.
</para>

<title>A directory Structure to Support Version Tracking</title>
<para>
This section describes the directory structure found inside SVN that will help
with all this Version stuff.  You should have an understanding of this, but
all the steps have automated ant tasks and scripts so the next section is of
more importance.
</para>
<para>There are 3 high level directories of immediate concern.  The following
describes the contents and uses of each.</para>

<variableList>
<varListEntry>
<term>trunk</term>
<listItem>
<para>
The trunk represents the core of the Inca developement.  This is what most
developers will have checked out most of the time.  It contains both the devel
directory where the components are developed and the contrib directory which
will hold all third party contributions.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>branches</term>
<listItem>
<para>
This directory will contain all release candidates.  Code should not be put
here until after the developer is very confident in the release readyness of
the code.  The only edits allowed on code in this directory are small bug
fixes and documentation updates.  
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>releases</term>
<listItem>
<para>
When a component or all of the components are actually packaged and released
to users they get moved to this directory.  There is a directory for each
release type under releases.  Under each of those directories is a symbolic
link called current.  It points to the most up to date release. 
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
</variableList>

<para>The following is an example snapshot of what the repository could look
like.</para>
<note><para>Keep in mind that a developer should never have all of this
checked at the same time.  Usually it is only necessary to have the trunk
checked out for developement</para></note>

<title>Automating Version Tracking -- Doing it</title>
<para>
By using the tools provided for the development cycle all versions will be
updated automatically.  The developer should never need to be aware of the
versions except to know how to retrieve on from the repository.
