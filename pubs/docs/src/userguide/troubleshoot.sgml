<para>This section will include debugging information about logging, the default inca.properties file, security (keys,
certs, etc.), "manpages" for each component and descriptions of manual resources. </para>

<title>Log Files</title>
<para>The agent, depot and consumer logs are located in the $INCA_DIST/var directory.  Reporter manager logs are located in each manager's install directory under the var directory (e.g. ~/incaReporterManager/var). </para>
<para>Logging is informational by default, but can be adjusted to be more verbose ('info' to 'debug') or less verbose ('info' to 'error') by editing the $INCA_DIST/etc/common/log4j.properties file and then restarting inca components.  For example, to log the most verbose globus error messages change line 33 in log4j.properties from "log4j.logger.org.globus=error" to "log4j.logger.org.globus=debug".</para>
