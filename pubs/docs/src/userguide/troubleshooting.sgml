<title>Log Files</title>
<para>The agent, depot and consumer logs are located in the $INCA_DIST/var directory.  Reporter manager logs are located in each manager's install directory under the var directory (e.g. ~/incaReporterManager/var). </para>
<para>Logging is informational by default, but can be adjusted to be more verbose ('info' to 'debug') or less verbose ('info' to 'error') by editing the $INCA_DIST/etc/common/log4j.properties file and then restarting inca components.  Note that passwords are logged when 'debug' logging is turned on.  Logging for the inca components can be adjusted by editing lines 26 and 27 ("log4j.rootLogger=info, stdout" and "log4j.logger.edu.sdsc.inca=info").  To log the most verbose globus error messages change line 33 in log4j.properties from "log4j.logger.org.globus=error" to "log4j.logger.org.globus=debug". </para>

If a reporter manager is not started on a resource after you have
scheduled reporters to run there, it is likely the build on that resource
failed.  You can confirm by looking for "Unable to stage reporter manager to "
in $INCA_DIST/var/agent.log.  If found, look for errors on the resource in the
2 build log files from the reporter manager build attempt:
~/incaReporterManager/build.log and
~/incaReporterManager/Inca-ReporterManager-*/build.log.  The most common
build failure is a bad build of the dependency Net::SSLeay which is
required for secure communication; the build for Net::SSLeay will fail if it
is unable to find OpenSSL on the resource.

<title>Authentication Problems</title>

<para>If you observe that a reporter manager on a resource is having trouble
connecting to either the agent or depot, there could be a problem with either
the installed SSL libraries or certificates.  To test, use the
<filename>inca-ping-client</filename> script installed with the reporter
manager as in the example below. Replace $RM_INSTALL_DIR with the path to the
directory where the reporter manager is installed. Supply the appropriate
hostname and port for either the depot or agent.  After pressing return, type
the password for the certificates.  </para>

<screen>
% cd <emphasis role="red">$RM_INSTALL_DIR</emphasis>
% env PERL5LIB=lib/perl bin/inca-ping-client \
  -c etc/rmcert.pem \
  -k etc/rmkey.pem -P true -t etc/trusted \
  -uri incas://<emphasis role="red">&lt;agent or depot hostname&gt;</emphasis>:<emphasis role="red">&lt;port&gt;</emphasis>
<emphasis role="red">&lt;your password&gt;</emphasis>
</screen>

<para> If there are no problems contacting either the agent or depot, the exit
code will be 0 and nothing will be printed to the screen.  If there is an
authentication problem, the exit code will be non-zero and a message such as
the following will be printed to stderr:</para>

<screen>
ERROR - Unable to create Inca::IO socket: : IO::Socket::INET configuration failed
Error contacting Inca server 'incas://rocks-101:6325' at bin/inca-ping-client line 137, &lt;STDIN&gt; line 1.
</screen>

<para>Please email inca@sdsc.edu if you are unable to determine the cause of 
the authentication problem.
