<para>By default, inca components use ssl to communicate with each other.  Credentials are automatically generated with the "bin/inca createauth" command described in step <xref linkend="qs-step4"> of the quickstart guide.  The createauth command creates keys and certificates for each inca component (the agent, depot, consumer and incat) and stores them in the $INCA_DIST/etc directory.</para>
