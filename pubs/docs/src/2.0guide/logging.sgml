<para>The agent, depot and consumer logs are located in the $INCA_DIST/var directory.  Reporter manager logs are located in each manager's install directory under the var directory (e.g. ~/incaReporterManager/var). </para>
<para>Logging is informational by default, but can be adjusted to be more verbose ('info' to 'debug') or less verbose ('info' to 'error') by editing the $INCA_DIST/etc/common/log4j.properties file and then restarting inca components.  Note that passwords are logged when 'debug' logging is turned on.  Logging for the inca components can be adjusted by editing lines 26 and 27 ("log4j.rootLogger=info, stdout" and "log4j.logger.edu.sdsc.inca=info").  To log the most verbose globus error messages change line 33 in log4j.properties from "log4j.logger.org.globus=error" to "log4j.logger.org.globus=debug". </para>
