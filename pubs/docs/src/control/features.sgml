<term><emphasis>Requirement:</emphasis>  The Inca framework should have a
minimal impact on the resources it is monitoring.</term>
<listItem>
<para>
  <itemizedList>
	<listItem>
		<para>In order to maintain a low impact on the system, we identify two
		distinct components of the control system:  a reporter manager and a
		reporter agent.  A reporter manager is a thin client which resides on a
		resource to manage the execution of a reporter suite.  A reporter agent
		manages one or more reporter managers and handles the bulk of the control
		processing.  
		</para>
  </listItem>
  <listItem>
  <para>
	The reporter manager will need to have multiple threads of control in order
	to accept commands from the reporter agent and local command-line GUI plus
	perform scheduling and monitoring of reporters.  These threads of control
	will be implemented efficiently in order to avoid unnecessary memory
	consumption.
  </para>
  </listItem>
  <listItem>
  <para>
  Each reporter will be profiled while it executes.  This information will
  be used to create timeouts on either wall clock time, CPU time, and/or memory.
  It will also be sent back with the report and logged in the depot so system
  administrators can use the information to tune the impact on the system.
	(also addresses Self Monitoring requirement)

<term><emphasis>Requirement:</emphasis>  Data collection scheduling and
execution should be flexible and configurable.</term> 
<listItem>
<para>
  <itemizedList>
	<listItem>
		<para>There will be two types of data collection:  scheduled and
		on-demand.  Scheduled execution will run a single reporter or 
		group of reporters continuously on its own schedule.  There will be a set
		of schedulers to choose from such as:  a queue scheduler, cross-site
		scheduler, pairwise measurement scheduler, etc.  The scheduling engine
		resides on the reporter agent.

<term><emphasis>Requirement</emphasis>:  Installation, setup, and maintenance
of the Inca deployment should be simple, straightforward, configurable, and
pain-free.</term>
<listItem>
<para>
  <itemizedList>
	<listItem>
		<para>Once installed (see <xref linkend="deployment">), the user should
		be able to describe their VO and the reporters they want to run using a
		GUI or configuration file.  
		</para>
  </listItem>
	<listItem>
		<para>The configuration of an Inca deployment should be done from a single
	 machine.  The user should be able to describe their requirements and
	 the reporter suites they want to run using a GUI or configuration file.  
		Each participating site will have some local control on their reporter
		manager as well and should be able to use a GUI to interact with it.
		</para>
  </listItem>
	<listItem>
		<para>Changes to an Inca deployment configuration should be done from a
		single machine and propagated down to the reporter managers.

<term><emphasis>Requirement</emphasis>:  In order to test Grid functionality,
access to a valid credential is needed from a reporter.
</term>
<listItem>
<para>
  <itemizedList>
	<listItem>
		<para>The reporter manager will run under a regular user account with a
		valid set of credentials with a DN that maps to that account.
