    The Inca core components will be made available through a variety of common
    package managers, including GPT, RPM, and Debian's.  The Inca project will
    produce its own packaging manager only if existing package managers fail to
    meet project requirements, e.g., for security.

    Individual core components will be available both in independent packages
    and in a combination package.  Common code will be included in all packages
    that require it; the installation process will avoid installing common
    code multiple times.

    <para>
    Inca Reporter Agents will automatically detect the availability of new
    versions of Reporters used by Reporter Managers under their control.  At
    the local administrator's discretion, Reporter Agents will automatically
    install new versions of Reporters when they become available.

    <para>
    Reporter packages produced by the Inca project will be structured to
    modularize code shared among Reporters.  Dependencies generated by this
    modularization will be noted in the package specifications so that RAs can
    automatically handle the installation of depended-on packages.
    </para>

    <para>
    We will investigate methods of deploying the Inca core software throughout
    a VO (installing RMs on all resources, RAs and Depots on selected
    resources) from a single central location.
