    Inca components will be made available through a variety of common
    package managers, including GPT, RPM, and Debian's.  The Inca project will
    produce its own packaging manager only if existing package managers fail to
    meet project requirements, e.g., for security.

    Inca Reporter Agents will automatically detect the availability of new
    versions of Reporters used by Reporter Managers under their control.  At
    the local administrator's discretion, Reporter Agents will automatically
    install new versions of Reporters when they become available.

    Packages produced by the Inca project will be structured to modularize code
    shared among Reporters.  Dependencies generated by this modularization will
    be noted in the package specifications so that package managers can
    automatically handle the installation of depended-on packages.

    We will investigate methods of deploying the Inca core software throughout
    a VO (installing Reporter Managers on all resources, Reporter Agents and
    Depots on selected resources) from a single central location.
