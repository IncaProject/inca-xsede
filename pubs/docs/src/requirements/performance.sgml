			<para>
			Collecting data from a resource requires system resources but that
			impact should be known and minimized.  Furthermore, some data (e.g.,
			running a benchmark) will require more system resources than other
			pieces of data and can be collected at a lower frequency.  Inca should
			profile the data collection methods and provide that information to
			Inca administrators so they can tune their configuration appropriately. 
			Any component of Inca that runs on the resource should run with
			a minimal amount of CPU and memory.
