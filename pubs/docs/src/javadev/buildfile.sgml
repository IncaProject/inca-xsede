<para>Required Targets</para>
<variableList>
<varListEntry>
<term>compile</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Compiles all of the projects source files and puts them into a directory named
classes in the same directory.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>clean</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Removes the classes directory and the test-results directory as well as any
other files that where generated during the build or run.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>dist</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Creates a binary distribution.  If the target is called with the property
build.output set then the build should be directory at that directory,
otherwise it should be directed at the current working directory.  This target
will read the dependencies file and create a lib directory in the build.output
directory and copy all of the required jar files to that directory.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>help</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Prints out each available target and a description.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>
<varListEntry>
<term>run-tests</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Runs all of the junit tests and puts the output into the test-output
directory. This target will depend upon the dist... in other words it can't be
run on a build file that does not exist in a dist directory.  If you want to
develop and test in the same directory leave build.output to be the current
working directory and run ant run-tests.  It will rebuild the project and run
the tests for you.
</para>
</listItem>
</varListEntry>

<term>jar</term>
<listItem>
<para>
Creates the jar file that contains all of the classes for this project.

directory.
