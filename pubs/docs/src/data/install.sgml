		<listItem><para>
		The user that the depot is running as will need to have access to a DBMS.
		The depot expects that there will be a database already create (albight
		empty) that is named inca.  How the authentication between database
		and depot takes place will need to be configurable - depending on which
		DBMS is used.  The name of the DB should be configurable - for situations
		where the user installing the db does not have premissions to create new
		databases in the DBMS.

		In the even that there is not an existing DBMS previously installed the
		depot will have an option for assisting with the installation of
		postgresql.
