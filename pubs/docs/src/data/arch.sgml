The data collected by Inca is managed using a peer to peer network of
depots. It is possible to configure the depots so that an entire VO depends on
a single Depot or several.

A depot can receive configuration information from reporter agents.  During
installation the public keys for the trusted reporter agents will be
installed.  Public keys for the reporter managers can be installed by a
reporter agent at any point during the depot's lifecycle, however, reports
received by an unknown reporter manager will be ignored.
