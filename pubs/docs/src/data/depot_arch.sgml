interface.  The updatader interacts with other Inca components and the
querying interface is the interface to the outside world.

		<para>
		The updater interface to the Depot handles all of the communication
		between the depot and other Inca components.  This includes handling
		incoming configuration from a Reporter Agent, incoming reporters from a
		Reporter Manager, and incoming reports from other Depots.  All of the
		communication with the updater is authenticated using ssl.
		</para>
		<para>
		The updater is also responsible for forwarding reports to other depots and
		caching them in the case that another depot is temporarily unavailable.

		<term>Depot-Querying Interface</term>
		<listItem>
		<para>
		The querying interface is responsible for handling all incoming queries.
		Queries can come in a variety of formats.  The modules that handle the
		separate formats should be pluggable, enabling new formats to be added.
		The job of the querying interface includes forwarding queries and merging
		results when neccesary.
