		An Inca administrator will need to authenticate and authorize itself

		Before making changes, a reporter manager will check the reporter agent's
		and Inca administrator's credentials.  This will limit access to a site's
		reporter manager and also guard against an administrator from one site
		requesting schedule changes to another site.
