<title>Anonymous Data</title>

Some pieces of data such as benchmarking data are useful to a VO internally
as well as their external community.   However, a VO may want "protect" its
sites somewhat by anonymizing its data.  For example, a VO could report a
bandwidth measurement that occurs between "site1" and "site2" and not the
actual resources/site used.

In order to do this within the Inca framework, the VO should deploy a 
private depot and direct its sensitive data there.  The VO should also deploy
a public depot.  A reporter should then be written that queries the private
depot and munges the data to "privatize" it. The reporter can then be
deployed in Inca such that it executes and places its data in the public
depot.  The external community can then access the public depot for the
anonymous data.  For example, a graduate student may be interested in real
bandwidth measurements for their model of Grids.
