<para>
Each Inca <emphasis>Reporter</emphasis> tests and reports the status of one
attribute of a resource.  These attributes are usually static (e.g.,
configuration) rather than dynamic (e.g., load average). However, Reporters
that measure dynamic resource attributes may be developed to cover areas where
data from other tools are absent.

<para>
Reporters are passive entities that run only when initiated by a
<emphasis>Reporter Manager</emphasis> (see <xref linkend="control-manager">).
They collect data, typically via system calls and/or by running system
programs, which they format into XML (see TODO) and print to stdout.
