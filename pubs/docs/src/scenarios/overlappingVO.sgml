<title>Overlapping VOs/Multiple Resources</title>

<para>
It is possible that a single resource belong to multiple Virtual
Organizations.  This implies that a Reporter Agent may not have direct access
to Reporter Manager.  In this case a the Reporter Manager's trusted Reporter
Agent will have to receive execution from the outside Reporter Agent.  The
primary Reporter Agent will be responsible for merging its own execution
requirements with those of outside Reporter Agents to form a single cohesive
execution schedule for the Reporter Manager.

<para>
The only components that can communicate outside of their primary VO are the
Depot and the Reporter Agents.  That is clear in the diagram.
