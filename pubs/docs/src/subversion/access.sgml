<title>Accessing the Inca Subversion repository</title>

<para>The Inca Subversion repository is located on
<filename>cuzco.sdsc.edu</filename> at 
<filename>/misc/inca/subversion</filename>.  Currently only ssh and local
authentication access methods are available.  You need an account on
<filename>cuzco.sdsc.edu</filename> and Subversion needs to be in your path.
Subversion is installed on <filename>cuzco.sdsc.edu</filename> at
<filename>/misc/inca/local</filename>.  You should edit your .cshrc (or
equivalent file) and either add <filename>/misc/inca/local/bin</filename> to
your path or source <filename>/misc/inca/local/setup.csh</filename> (which
will do it for you).
