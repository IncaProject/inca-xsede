<para>
In order to ensure a robust system the components within Inca need to monitor
each other and have the ability to recover from failures when possible.  The
following is a list of each component and methods for both detecting failure
and recovering, when possible.
</para>
<variableList>
	<varListEntry>
	<term>Depot</term>
	<listItem><para>A Depot failure can be detected by both the reporter manager
	and the reporter agent.  One of the design goal is to maintain the lowest
	system impact on the reporter managers as possible, therefore, the
	responsibility of detecting and handling a depot failure falls to the
	reporter agent.  The only exception to this is that a reporter manager
	should have multiple depots that it is able to send reports to.  This will
	enable the manager to switch to a different depot for the duration of the
	failure.  It is the responsibility of the secondary depot to log all
	interactions with this reporter manager and update the failed depot when it
	recovers.  The reporter manager will need to use exponential
	back-off to decide when to attempt communication with a failed depot.

	<varListEntry>
	<term>Database Server</term>
	<listItem><para>
	The failure of a database server will be detectable by the depot.
	In this case the depot should log all changes that should have been sent to 
	the depot and hide this failure from the other components.  The only 
	operation that will not be able to continue is queries.  All others can be 
	cached with no lost data.  Queries during a database server failure will have
	to return failures.

	<varListEntry>
	<term>Reporter Agent</term>
	<listItem><para>
	 This will be detectable by the reporter manager and other reporter agents.
	 The reporter manager can work independently of the manager but not changes 
	 will be propagated during this time.  
	</para></listItem>
	</varListEntry>

	<varListEntry>
	<term>Reporter Manager</term>
	<listItem><para>
	The reporter agent will need to monitor for this failure and should 
	automatically recover when possible.
