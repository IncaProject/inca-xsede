<glossentry id="reporter-agent">
  <glossterm>Reporter Agent (RA)</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
	<para>
  A <emphasis>reporter agent</emphasis> is the component of the control
  framework of Inca that is responsible for servicing requests for the
  collection of specified data sets at possibly regular intervals and
  configuring its storage requirements.  The data set is collected by
  delegating the execution of a corresponding reporter suite to a locally
  managed set of reporter managers (a reporter manager runs on each resource).

<glossentry id="reporter-manager">
  <glossterm>Reporter Manager (RM)</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
	<para>
  A <emphasis>reporter manager</emphasis> is a thin client of the control
  framework of Inca which executes on the monitored resources.  It handles
  scheduled and local-execution of reporters and stores the resulting data
  into a Depot.  A reporter manager trusts one and only one reporter agent who
  it registers with and accepts control changes from.

<glossentry id="reporter-repository">
  <glossterm>Reporter Repository (RR)</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
	<para>
  A <emphasis>reporter repository</emphasis> is a trusted authority that hosts
  a directory of reporters and reporter libraries that can be fetched
  from a reporter agent and used in an Inca deployment to collect data from
  resources.

<glossentry id="subscription">
  <glossterm>Subscription</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
	<para>
  A <emphasis>subscription</emphasis> is lower-level set of instructions used
  between Inca components that describe a set of reporters to be executed on a
  single resource.  It is formatted as an XML document that contains a
  submission type (i.e., add,  replace, or delete) and a list of reporter
  groups where each reporter group contains elements, where each reporter
  element lists the reporter name, a resource, list of input arguments,
  frequency of execution, and execution priority.

<glossentry id="suite">
  <glossterm>Suite</glossterm>
  <glossdef>
	<para>
  A <emphasis>suite</emphasis> is a high-level description of specific data
  set to be collected by an Inca deployment.  It is an XML document that
  describes the data, where to collect it, how often to collect it, accepted
  values for the data, and archiving instructions.
