The I3 serves as the client interface to an RA.  The I3 user specifies a list of
RRs to serve as the source of reporters for the VO.  The I3 forwards this list
to the RA, which retrieves catalog information from each RR, merges them, and
returns the complete list of reporters to the I3.  The I3 then allows the
administrator to select a set of reporters to run on the VO resources and
specifies running parameters for each.  This information is returned to the RA,
which uses it to download reporters from the RRs and construct schedules for
transmission to RMs.
