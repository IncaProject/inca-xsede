The I3 provides to the Inca administrator a client interface to an RA.  All
information about the configuration of an Inca installation is kept with the
RA and retrieved by the I3 as needed.
</para>
<para>
The I3 allows the Inca administrator to specify a list of RRs that serve as the
source of reporters for the installation.  The I3 forwards this list to the RA,
which retrieves catalog information from each RR, merges the catalogs, and
returns the complete list of available reporters to the I3.  The administrator
selects a set of reporters to run on installation resources, specifying run
attributes for each. This information is returned to the RA, which uses it to
download reporters from the RRs and construct schedules for transmission to RMs.

The attributes of a particular reporter run include: the name and version of
the reporter; the resource on which it is to be run (i.e., the RM name), any
command-line arguments to be passed; the initial run time; how often the
reporter should be run; the Depot(s) to which the results should be sent;
optionally, the maximum CPU and/or wall clock time that a single reporter run
will be allowed to consume; a list of expected output values.  For convenience,
the version of a reporter may be specified as "current", in which case the
RA will automatically update the reporter as new versions become available.
