<title>Version Tracking Concepts</title>
<para>
Within Inca there are 2 major concepts behind versions.  The first is the Inca
version which is made of 2 number seperated by a comma.  For the immediate
future it will always be 2.[releaseNumber] where releaseNumber starts at 0.
The second is the component versions.  They are tracked locally and made of 2
numbers as well.  Each should start at 1.1.  When a component is released its
version is a concatination of the two.  So the first depot release will be
2.0.1.1

<para>
The Inca version is updated each time all of the components are packaged and
released together.

<para>
The component versions are updated at 2 events.  The minor version is updated
everytime a new copy is checked into stable and the major version is updated
everytime a stable version is accepted and packaged for release.

process.  This will be done using the hook scripts.  Proceedures for how to
utilize this automation will be published here when they are figured out.
