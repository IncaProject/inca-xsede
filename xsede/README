Status pages
  - Available from inca.teragrid.org
  - Some top-level pages are pregenerated from a cron script on sapa
  - We store regular expressions for resources to show external tests and 
    handle notifications correctly in a few places:
    -- google.xml
    -- files for kits that have external tests (data movement and remote compute)
    -- repo runs most of the external tests and repeats some hostname macros, but 
       this will be fixed once we implement Jen's resource->macro syntax on TG
    -- etc/filter.properties is used for the downtime filter
    -- sbin/EmailNotifier is used for external test notification

Email notifications
  - Each account has cron scripts to make sure Inca is not out of control 
    (i.e., check for number of processes) - log in and kill all processes; 
    agent can then restart the reporter manager
