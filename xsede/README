Status pages
  - Available from inca.xsede.org
  - Some top-level pages are pregenerated from a cron script on capac
  - We store regular expressions for resources to show external tests and 
    handle notifications correctly in a few places:
    -- google.xml
    -- files for kits that have external tests (data movement and remote compute)
    -- quarry runs most of the external tests and repeats some hostname macros, but 
       this will be fixed once we implement Jen's resource->macro syntax on TG
    -- etc/filter.properties is used for the downtime filter
    -- sbin/EmailNotifier is used for external test notification

Email notifications
  - Some notifications are in the sbin/EmailNotifier until the resource->macro
    syntax can handle external tests.  Otherwise, most email is defined on 
    the leaf resource (sdsc-dash) or site (e.g. SDSC) level

Deployment Information
  - Values for macros are based off information from MDS from
    http://info.teragrid.org:8080/webmds/webmds?info=tgislocal&xsl=kitsregistration
  - Backups of db and var directory are stored in /localdisk/inca/backups if a
    restore is needed
