-------------------
Remaining for 11/2:
-------------------

1) Turn off inca1

  a) figure out bg, and datastar bash problem (Kate)
  b) compare inca1 and inca2 results (Kate)
  c) improve speed of xslt (Kate)


2) Restart summary information and critical tests pages (one category)

  a) write JSP tag for cross-site tests (Shava)
  b) write xsl for pass/fail percentage with xsl (Kate)

       for each resource
         openssh_to_<resource>
         if all fail => universal failure
       for each resource
         openssh_to_<resource>
           if all succeed == green
           if all failures are also universal failures == yellow
           if one or more non-universal failure == red

     Inputs: list of cross-site tests (ctss3.xml), reportsummaries

     Output:

       <resource>
         <cross-site-nickname>
           <numSuccesses>
           <numNonUniversalFailures>
           <numFailures>
           <numTotal>


3) Split the globus4-cs tests into two (gatekeeper and gridftp) and  
redefine the color coding for the cross site tests:  green = success  
at all targets which don't have universal failures, yellow (with  
number of successes) = success at 1 or more targets, red = failure on  
all targets. 

  a) revise xsl to show green, yellow, red (Kate)
