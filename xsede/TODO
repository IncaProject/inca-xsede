Programming tasks
-------------------
* tune the frequency of a test based on results -- i.e., if a test fails,
  start testing it more frequently (Kate to Tony - 2/26)

* error printing out from summary page stylesheet to stdout -- still generated
  though (Shava)

* show which errors are in ticketing system (Tony 10/30) 

* add form for sys admins to input comments about errors (Tony 10/30)

* run now button from web page for admins (Doru)

* a diff capability to see which tests are still failing from one week
to the next, which ones were resolved, and new tests that are failing (shava
to tony - 12/1/06)

* for a test that is failing on a single resource, being able to view
the history of pass/fail to whether it is happening often enough that it
should be addressed or is just a fluke.  Also being able to view the
different types of error messages that have occurred and when, for
example, when you wanted to know whether that uberftp fail message 'file
does not match original' had happened before. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)

* for the flaky gt4 services, being able to see a graph where you could
use check boxes to select the pass/fail history to see how often a
service is failing and one which resources.  Also example, being able to
view how much more reliable the services are on resources which have
deployed the patches, and so on. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)

* shade resources based on planned downtimes

* email notification for MDS tests and others

-------------------
Deployment tasks
-------------------
* change name of resources to that of group & use equivalent
