the history of pass/fail to whether it is happening often enough that it
should be addressed or is just a fluke.  Also being able to view the

* for the flaky gt4 services, being able to see a graph where you could
use check boxes to select the pass/fail history to see how often a

deployed the patches, and so on. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)
