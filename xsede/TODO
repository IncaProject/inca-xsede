* for a test that is failing on a single resource, being able to view
the history of pass/fail to whether it is happening often enough that it
should be addressed or is just a fluke.  Also being able to view the
different types of error messages that have occurred and when, for
example, when you wanted to know whether that uberftp fail message 'file
does not match original' had happened before. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)

* for the flaky gt4 services, being able to see a graph where you could
use check boxes to select the pass/fail history to see how often a
service is failing and one which resources.  Also example, being able to
view how much more reliable the services are on resources which have
deployed the patches, and so on. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)
