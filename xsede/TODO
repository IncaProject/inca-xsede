----------
Due 10/30:
----------

1) Create a webpage with, for each of the tested components, the  
names and description (with a link to the scripts) of each of the  
unit tests. This page should be regenerated after each INCA test  
suite change. 

  a) Write getRepositoryXML in agentClient (Jim) -- DONE
  b) Write JSP tag getSuites for consumer (Shava) -- DONE
  c) Write JSP tag getRepository for consumer (Shava) -- DONE
  c) Write JSP page to combine result from getSuites and getRepository (Shava) -- DONE
  d) Write XSL stylesheet (Kate) ***

----------
Due 11/2:
----------
1) Turn off inca1

  -- get inca2 working on DS - DONE
     -- Net::SSLeay now installed

  -- use env perl for reporters (Kate) -- DONE
     
  -- figure out tungsten, bg, and datastar  bugs (Kate) ***
  -- compare inca1 and inca2 results (Kate) ***
  -- improve speed of xslt (Kate) (low priority)
  -- show which results are out of date (Kate) ***

2) Restart summary information and critical tests pages
   (one category)

  Inputs: ctssv3.xml, reportSummaries, and JSP tag results

  -- pass/fail percentage with xsl (Kate)
     
  -- write JSP tag for cross-site tests (Kate & Shava) ***

       for each resource
         openssh_to_<resource>
         if all fail => universal failure
       for each resource
         openssh_to_<resource>
           if all succeed == green
           if all failures are also universal failures == yellow
           if one or more non-universal failure == red

     Inputs: list of cross-site tests (ctss3.xml), reportsummaries

     Output:

       <resource>
         <cross-site-nickname>
           <numSuccesses>
           <numNonUniversalFailures>
           <numFailures>
           <numTotal>

3) Split the globus4-cs tests into two (gatekeeper and gridftp) and  
redefine the color coding for the cross site tests:  green = success  
at all targets which don't have universal failures, yellow (with  
number of successes) = success at 1 or more targets, red = failure on  
all targets. 

  -- revise xsl to show green, yellow, red (Kate)
