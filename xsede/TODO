Programming tasks
-------------------
* add javascript to the index.xsl to specify certain xml files with certain
  suites & maybe stylesheet too? (steven 12/7)

* write xsl for pass/fail percentage with xsl (Kate)

* improve speed of xslt (Kate)
  - restore Shava's optimizations

* error printing out from summary page stylesheet to stdout -- still generated

* run now button from web page for admins (Doru)

* a diff capability to see which tests are still failing from one week
to the next, which ones were resolved, and new tests that are failing (shava
to tony - 12/1/06)

* for a test that is failing on a single resource, being able to view
the history of pass/fail to whether it is happening often enough that it
should be addressed or is just a fluke.  Also being able to view the
different types of error messages that have occurred and when, for
example, when you wanted to know whether that uberftp fail message 'file
does not match original' had happened before. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)

* for the flaky gt4 services, being able to see a graph where you could
use check boxes to select the pass/fail history to see how often a
service is failing and one which resources.  Also example, being able to
view how much more reliable the services are on resources which have
deployed the patches, and so on. (shava to tony - 12/1/06)

  "The following page lists the compilers supported by RPs on each resource.
  
  http://software.teragrid.org/docs/ctss3/mpi/README.supported
  
  I think you should e-mail software-wg and confirm which of the listed
  compilers should be used for testing BLAS."
